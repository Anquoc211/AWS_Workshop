### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
I was most satisfied with the open learning environment and dedicated mentorship. Working on real projects and receiving detailed feedback helped me progress significantly. Especially, the culture of encouraging questions and experimentation helped me confidently develop my skills.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
I would definitely recommend friends to intern here. The main reasons are the practical learning environment and enthusiastic team. Interns don't just do simple tasks but participate in real projects, receive detailed guidance, and have opportunities to develop both technical and soft skills. This is an ideal place for those who want to learn and develop seriously.
