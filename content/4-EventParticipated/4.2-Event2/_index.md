## AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)

### Core Principles

**You Remain in Control**  
AI serves as your assistant, not your replacement. Maintain decision-making authority over project direction and technical choices.

**Bidirectional Collaboration**  
AI should ask critical questions about requirements, architecture, and goals. The relationship is collaborative, with you guiding AI's suggestions.

**Plan Before Code**  
Create comprehensive plans before implementation. AI can help generate plans, but you must review and validate them.

### Development Workflow

**1. Project Planning**
- Define clear requirements and scope
- Generate initial plans with AI assistance
- Review and refine until detailed and unambiguous

**2. User Story Creation**
- Break down plans into user stories with acceptance criteria
- Divide scope into manageable units
- Assign stories to team members

**3. Technology Stack Definition**
- Specify frameworks, tools, and technologies
- Provide positive direction rather than constraints
- Clear specifications yield better results

**4. Requirements & Design**
- Write precise, detailed requirements
- Create specifications collaboratively with AI
- Define data models, APIs, and system architecture

**5. Implementation**
- Build according to the plan
- Use collaborative development approaches
- Verify all AI-generated code as a team

**6. Testing & Deployment**
- Progress through environments: Dev → QA → UAT → Production
- Validate at each quality gate
- Ensure functionality before release

### Success Factors

- **Plan First** - Don't expect AI to manage everything
- **Review Regularly** - Validate AI outputs continuously
- **Manage Actively** - Your value is in validation and oversight
- **Ask Questions** - Ensure AI understands your context
- **Use Templates** - Structure prompts with context and requirements
- **Document Plans** - Export plans as files for reference
- **Stay Respectful** - Maintain professional communication with AI

## Kiro IDE

### Overview

Kiro is an agentic IDE from AWS that bridges rapid AI prototyping and production-ready development. Currently in public preview, it maintains professional standards while enhancing productivity.

### Core Features

**Spec-Driven Development**
- Converts requirements into structured specifications
- Generates user stories with acceptance criteria
- Creates design documentation before coding
- Plans implementation systematically

**Agent Automation**
- Triggers tasks automatically on events
- Updates documentation on file saves
- Generates tests on commits
- Optimizes performance based on actions

**Project Context**
- Uses steering files (markdown) for guidelines
- Understands project structure deeply
- Applies coding standards consistently
- Follows team best practices

**Multi-File Intelligence**
- Analyzes multiple files simultaneously
- Understands functional goals across codebase
- Aligns changes with project objectives
- Goes beyond simple completion

**VS Code Foundation**
- Built on VS Code open source

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**Over-Reliance on AI**  
*Solution:* Plan first, review regularly. AI enhances, not replaces developer judgment.

**High Error Rates**  
*Solution:* Implement review cycles. Validate all AI-generated code.

**Vague Requirements**  
*Solution:* Write precise requirements. Create detailed specifications collaboratively.

**Negative Instructions**  
*Solution:* Use positive, specific direction. Tell AI what to do, not what to avoid.

**Missing Context**  
*Solution:* Create steering files. Provide detailed context. Ask critical questions.

**AI as Manager**  
*Solution:* You manage the project. Your value is in validation and oversight.

## Key Takeaways

- **Maintain Control:** You are the manager; AI is your assistant
- **Plan Strategically:** Create comprehensive plans before coding
- **Collaborate Effectively:** AI should question and collaborate, not just execute
- **Specify Clearly:** Precise requirements yield better AI outputs
- **Review Continuously:** Validate AI suggestions regularly
- **Focus on Value:** Your expertise matters in validation and architecture
- **Structure Prompts:** Use templates with context and requirements
- **Document Thoroughly:** Export plans as living reference documents
- **Direct Positively:** Positive instructions work better than constraints
- **Practice Actively:** Hands-on experience reveals capabilities and limits
