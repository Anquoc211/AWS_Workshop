# **Lecture Notes**

## Database Concepts Review

- A **database** is an organized (or semi-structured) collection of information stored on storage devices to support concurrent access by multiple users or programs with different goals.

### Sessions

- A **session** spans from the moment a client connects to the DBMS until the connection is terminated.

### Primary Key

- A **primary key** uniquely identifies each row in a relational table.

### Foreign Key

- A **foreign key** in one table references the **primary key** of another table, creating a relationship between them.

### Index

- An **index** accelerates data retrieval at the cost of extra writes and storage to maintain the index structure.
- Indexes locate data without scanning every row; they can be defined over one or more columns.

**Index Types:**

- **B-Tree:** General purpose, balanced tree structure
- **Hash:** Fast equality lookups
- **Bitmap:** Efficient for low-cardinality columns
- **Full-Text:** Text search optimization

### Partitioning

- **Partitioning** splits a large table into smaller, independent pieces (partitions), potentially placed on different storage.
- Benefits: better query performance, easier maintenance, and scalability.
- Common types:
  - **Range** (e.g., by date)
  - **List**
  - **Hash**
  - **Composite** (combination)

**Partitioning Example:**

```sql
-- Range partitioning by date
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date)) (
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION p2025 VALUES LESS THAN (2026)
);
```

### Execution Plan / Query Plan

- A **query plan** details how the DBMS will execute an SQL statement (access paths, joins, sorts).
- Types:
  - **Estimated plan** (before execution)
  - **Actual plan** (from executed query)
- Key operators: table scan, index seek/scan, nested loops, hash/merge join, sort, aggregate, filter.

### Database Logs

- **Database logs** record all changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and operations.
- Typical log types: **transaction**, **redo**, **undo**, **binary** logs.
- Uses: recovery, integrity, consistency/durability (ACID), replication, performance analysis.

---

### Buffers

- A **buffer pool** caches pages read from disk to minimize I/O.
- Management strategies:
  - Replacement: LRU, FIFO, Clock
  - Write policies: immediate vs. deferred
  - **Prefetching** to warm the cache

# **Hands-On Labs**

## Lab 05 – Amazon RDS & EC2 Integration (Part 1)

1. Create a VPC → *05-2.1*  
2. Create EC2 Security Group → *05-2.2*  
3. Create RDS Security Group → *05-2.3*  
4. Create DB Subnet Group → *05-2.4*
