## EC2 Advanced Features

### Instance Store

- **Instance Store** provides temporary block-level storage physically attached to the EC2 host.  

**Characteristics**

- Very high I/O and throughput  
- Data lost when instance stops or terminates  
- Cannot be detached or snapshotted  

**Use Cases**

- Caching or temporary data processing  
- Applications with their own redundancy or replication

**Instance Store vs EBS:**

| Feature | Instance Store | EBS |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Persistence | Temporary | Persistent |
| Performance | Very high | High |
| Snapshot | No | Yes |
| Detachable | No | Yes |
| Cost | Included | Additional |

### User Data

- **User Data** scripts run automatically at instance launch (once per AMI provision).  
- Linux – bash scripts  
- Windows – PowerShell scripts

**User Data Examples:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

### Metadata

- **EC2 Instance Metadata** provides details about the running instance such as private/public IP, hostname, and security groups.  
- Often used in user data scripts for dynamic configuration.

**Accessing Metadata:**

```bash
# Get instance ID
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id

# Get public IP
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

# Get IAM role credentials
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role-name
