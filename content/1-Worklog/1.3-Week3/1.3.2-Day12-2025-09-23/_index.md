## EC2 Storage & Security

### Backup in EC2

- **AWS Backup** provides centralized backup for AWS services including EC2.  
- **EBS Snapshots** back up EBS volumes:
  - Point-in-time backups  
  - Incremental (stores only changed blocks)  
  - Stored in S3 (not directly accessible)  
- **AMI Backup** captures the full EC2 configuration as an image.

**Snapshot Best Practices:**

- Schedule regular snapshots
- Copy snapshots to other regions for DR
- Tag snapshots for lifecycle management
- Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)

### Key Pair

- **Key Pairs** are used for secure authentication when connecting to EC2:
  - **Public Key** – stored on the instance  
  - **Private Key** – kept by the user for SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows)  
- Replaces passwords for better security.  
- **Important:** If you lose your private key, AWS cannot recover it.

**Key Pair Management:**

- Create key pairs in AWS or import your own
- Store private keys securely
- Use different key pairs for different environments
- Rotate keys regularly

### Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- **Amazon EBS** provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances.  
- Volume types:
  - **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)** – balance between performance & cost  
  - **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)** – for high IOPS workloads  
  - **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)** – for large, sequential data  
  - **Cold HDD (sc1)** – low-cost, infrequently accessed data  

**Key Features**

- Attach/detach volumes from instances  
- Data persists when instances stop  
- Create snapshots for backup or cross-region copy  
- Automatically replicated within an AZ

**EBS Volume Comparison:**

| Type | Use Case | Max IOPS | Max Throughput |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|
| gp3 | General purpose | 16,000 | 1,000 MB/s |
| io2 | High performance | 64,000 | 1,000 MB/s |
| st1 | Big data | 500 | 500 MB/s |
| sc1 | Cold storage | 250 | 250 MB/s |
