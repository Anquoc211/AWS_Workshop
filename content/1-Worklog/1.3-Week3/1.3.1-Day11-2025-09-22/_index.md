# **Lecture Notes**

## Compute on AWS

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

- **Amazon EC2** provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, similar to a virtual or physical server.  
- It supports workloads such as web hosting, applications, databases, authentication services, and other general-purpose server tasks.  

**Instance Types**

- EC2 configurations are defined by **instance types**, not custom hardware.  
- Each type specifies:
  - CPU (Intel, AMD, ARM – Graviton 1/2/3) / GPU
  - Memory  
  - Network  
  - Storage

**Instance Type Categories:**

- **General Purpose:** T3, T4g, M5, M6i (balanced compute, memory, networking)
- **Compute Optimized:** C5, C6i, C7g (high-performance processors)
- **Memory Optimized:** R5, R6i, X2 (fast performance for memory-intensive workloads)
- **Storage Optimized:** I3, D2, H1 (high sequential read/write to local storage)
- **Accelerated Computing:** P4, G5, Inf1 (GPU/FPGA for ML, graphics)

### Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** is a template that defines the software configuration of an instance, including OS, apps, and settings.  
- Types of AMIs:
  - Provided by AWS (Amazon Linux, Windows, Ubuntu, etc.)  
  - AWS Marketplace AMIs  
  - Custom AMIs created by users  

**Benefits of Custom AMIs**

- Faster instance launch and setup  
- Simplified backup and restore  
- Consistent environment across multiple instances  

**AMI Components:**

- Root volume template (OS and applications)
- Launch permissions
- Block device mapping
