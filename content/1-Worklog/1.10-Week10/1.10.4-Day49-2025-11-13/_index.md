# **Lecture Notes**

## Book Reading Experience

### CloudFront Signed URLs for Content Delivery

**Security Strategy:**
- Books stored in S3 `public/books/` but **not publicly accessible**
- CloudFront configured with **Origin Access Control (OAC)**
- S3 bucket policy allows only CloudFront to access objects
- Lambda generates **signed GET URLs** with short TTL (15 minutes)
- Users access content through signed URLs only

**Signed URL Flow:**
```
User clicks "Read" → Frontend calls /books/{id}/read API → 
Lambda validates user authentication → Lambda checks book status (APPROVED) →
Lambda generates CloudFront signed URL → Returns URL to frontend →
Frontend loads PDF/ePub via signed URL
```

### PDF/ePub Rendering

**Implementation Options:**
- **react-pdf**: Render PDF in browser with canvas
- **PDF.js**: Mozilla's PDF viewer (more features)
- **epub.js**: ePub reader with customization
- **iframe**: Simple but less control

**Reader Features:**
- Page navigation (previous/next)
- Zoom in/out
- Fullscreen mode
- Bookmark support (store in DynamoDB)
- Reading progress tracking

## Search & Discovery

### DynamoDB GSI-Based Search

**Search Strategy:**
- Create **Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)** for searchable fields
- GSI1: `PK=TITLE#{normalizedTitle}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}`
- GSI2: `PK=AUTHOR#{normalizedAuthor}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}`
- Query GSI instead of expensive Scan operations

**Search Flow:**
```
User types search query → Frontend calls /search API with query params →
Lambda determines which GSI(s) to query →
Query GSI1 (title) and/or GSI2 (author) →
Intersection of results if multiple params →
BatchGetItem to fetch full book metadata →
Return results to frontend
```

### Frontend Search Implementation

**Search Components:**
- Search bar with autocomplete
- Filter panel (by author, genre, upload date)
- Sort options (newest, oldest, popular)
- Results grid/list view toggle
- Pagination or infinite scroll

**Search Optimization:**
- Debounce search input (wait 300ms after typing)
- Cache recent search results (5 minutes)
- Show loading skeleton during search
- Display "No results" with suggestions

## Key Insights

- Signed URLs essential for content security - never expose S3 directly
- Short TTL on signed URLs prevents sharing/abuse
- GSI queries much cheaper and faster than Scan
- Normalized fields (lowercase, no special chars) improve search accuracy
- Client-side caching reduces API calls and improves UX

# **Challenges & Solutions**

**Challenge:** PDF rendering performance issues with large files  
**Solution:** Implemented lazy loading of pages (render visible pages only) and used Web Workers for PDF parsing

**Challenge:** Signed URLs expiring during reading session  
**Solution:** Implemented auto-refresh mechanism that requests new URL 2 minutes before expiration

**Challenge:** Search returning too many results causing slow UI  
**Solution:** Implemented server-side pagination with cursor-based navigation and virtual scrolling

**Challenge:** ePub text selection interfering with page turns  
**Solution:** Added touch/click handlers with gesture detection to differentiate between selection and navigation
