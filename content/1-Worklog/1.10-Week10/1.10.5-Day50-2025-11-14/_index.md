# **Lecture Notes**

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing Approach

**Unit Testing:**
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Focus on business logic and user interactions
- Tools: Jest, React Testing Library

**Integration Testing:**
- Test component interactions and data flow
- Verify API integration with mock servers
- Test authentication flows end-to-end
- Tools: Cypress, Playwright

**E2E Testing:**
- Simulate real user workflows
- Test critical paths (upload, approve, read)
- Verify production environment behavior
- Tools: Cypress E2E, manual QA

### Testing Checklist

**Authentication Flow:**
- ✓ User can register with email
- ✓ Email verification works correctly
- ✓ User can login and receive JWT
- ✓ Protected routes redirect to login
- ✓ Admin role detection works
- ✓ Token refresh happens automatically

**Upload Flow:**
- ✓ File validation (size, type) works
- ✓ Presigned URL generation succeeds
- ✓ Direct S3 upload with progress tracking
- ✓ Status updates correctly (PENDING → VALIDATING)
- ✓ Error handling for failed uploads

**Admin Approval:**
- ✓ Only admins can access approval page
- ✓ Pending books list displays correctly
- ✓ Approve action moves file and updates status
- ✓ Reject action updates status with reason
- ✓ Audit logs record all actions

**Reader Experience:**
- ✓ Book list displays approved books only
- ✓ Search functionality returns accurate results
- ✓ Signed URL generation works
- ✓ PDF/ePub renders correctly in reader
- ✓ URL expiration handled gracefully

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Code Quality:**
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- ESLint warnings addressed
- Build succeeds without errors
- No console.log statements in production

**Environment Variables:**
- All required env vars set in Amplify Console
- Production API endpoint configured
- Cognito User Pool IDs correct
- CloudFront distribution ID set

**Security Review:**
- S3 bucket policies restrict public access
- CloudFront OAC configured correctly
- API Gateway JWT validation enabled
- CORS configured for production domain only

### Amplify Deployment

**Automatic Deployment:**
```
GitHub push (main branch) → 
Amplify webhook triggers → 
Install dependencies → 
Build Next.js app → 
Deploy to CDN → 
Live at custom domain
```

**Build Settings:**
- Node.js version specified (18.x)
- Build commands configured
- Environment variables injected
- Output directory set correctly

**Post-Deployment Verification:**
- Site loads successfully
- SSL certificate active
- All routes accessible
- API calls working
- Authentication functional

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization

**Code Splitting:**
- Lazy load heavy components (PDF reader, ePub viewer)
- Dynamic imports for admin pages
- Route-based code splitting

**Image Optimization:**
- Next.js Image component for book covers
- Lazy loading images below fold
- WebP format with fallbacks

**Caching Strategy:**
- React Query caching for API responses
- Service worker for offline capability (future)
- LocalStorage for user preferences

### Monitoring Setup

**CloudWatch Integration:**
- Frontend error tracking via CloudWatch RUM
- API Gateway access logs
- Lambda execution logs
- Custom metrics for key actions

**Performance Metrics:**
- Page load time tracking
- API response time monitoring
- Upload success/failure rates
- User engagement metrics

## Key Insights

- Comprehensive testing catches issues before users encounter them
- Automated CI/CD reduces deployment friction and human error
- Performance optimization is ongoing - monitor and iterate
- User feedback post-launch is invaluable for prioritizing improvements
- Documentation essential for onboarding and maintenance

# **Challenges & Solutions**

**Challenge:** Cypress tests failing in CI/CD pipeline  
**Solution:** Configured proper base URL and added retry logic for network-dependent tests

**Challenge:** Build failing due to environment variable issues  
**Solution:** Used `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side env vars and documented all required variables

**Challenge:** PDF rendering causing memory issues on mobile  
**Solution:** Implemented page-by-page rendering and disabled pre-caching on mobile devices

**Challenge:** Race condition between token refresh and API calls  
**Solution:** Implemented request queue that waits for token refresh before proceeding
