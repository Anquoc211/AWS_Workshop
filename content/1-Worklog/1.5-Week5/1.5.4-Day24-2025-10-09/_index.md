# **Lecture Notes**

## Service Control Policies (SCPs)

- Define **maximum permissions** for accounts; they **limit** but do not grant permissions.  
- Apply to accounts or OUs; affect all users/roles, **including root**; **Deny overrides Allow**.

**Example SCP (deny bucket deletion)**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    { 
      "Effect": "Deny", 
      "Action": ["s3:DeleteBucket"], 
      "Resource": "*" 
    }
  ]
}
```

**SCP Use Cases:**

- Prevent accounts from leaving the organization
- Restrict regions where resources can be created
- Enforce encryption requirements
- Prevent disabling security services
- Require specific tags on resources

**SCP Best Practices:**

- Start with least privilege
- Test in non-production first
- Use explicit denies for critical controls
- Document SCP purposes
- Regular review and updates

## AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)

- Centralizes access to AWS accounts and external applications.
- Identity sources: built-in, AWS Managed Microsoft AD, on-prem AD (trust/AD Connector), or external IdPs.
- **Permission Sets** define what users/groups can do in target accounts (materialized as IAM roles). Multiple permission sets per user are supported.

**Identity Center Features:**

- Single sign-on to multiple AWS accounts
- Integration with Microsoft Active Directory
- SAML 2.0 support
- Multi-factor authentication
- Centralized permission management
- Audit logging with CloudTrail

## AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

- Managed keys for data protection with deep service integration and full auditability.

**Highlights**

- Create/manage keys without operating your own HSM infrastructure.
- Fine-grained access via IAM & key policies; usage logged in CloudTrail.

**Key categories**

- Customer-managed keys, AWS-managed keys, and AWS-owned keys.

**KMS Key Types:**

- **Symmetric:** Single encryption key (AES-256)
- **Asymmetric:** Public/private key pair (RSA, ECC)

**KMS Features:**

- Automatic key rotation
- Key policies and grants
- Envelope encryption
- Integration with AWS services
- CloudTrail logging
- Multi-region keys
