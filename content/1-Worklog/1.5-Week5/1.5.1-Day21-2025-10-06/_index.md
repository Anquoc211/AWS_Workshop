# **Lecture Notes**

## Security

### Shared Responsibility Model

- In cloud computing, security is a **shared responsibility** between the cloud provider and the customer.  
- Customers must securely configure services, apply best practices, and use security controls from the hypervisor exposure upward to application/data layers.

- The split of responsibilities varies by service model:
  - Infrastructure-level services
  - Partially managed services
  - Fully managed services

**AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the Cloud):**

- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and network infrastructure
- Virtualization infrastructure
- Managed service operations

**Customer Responsibilities (Security IN the Cloud):**

- Data encryption
- Network configuration
- Access management
- Application security
- Operating system patches (for EC2)

## AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Root Account

- Has unrestricted access to all AWS services/resources and can remove any attached permissions.  
- Best practices:
  - Create and use an **IAM Administrator** user for daily operations.
  - Lock away root credentials (dual control).  
  - Keep the root user's email and domain valid and renewed.
  - Enable MFA on root account

### IAM Overview

- IAM controls access to AWS services and resources in your account.  
- **Principals** include: root user, IAM users, federated users, IAM roles, assumed-role sessions, AWS services, and anonymous users.  
- Notes:
  - IAM users are not separate AWS accounts.
  - New IAM users start with **no permissions**.
  - Grant permissions by attaching **policies** to users, groups, or roles.
  - Use **IAM groups** to manage many users (groups cannot be nested).

## Lab 48 – IAM Access Keys & Roles (Part 1)

1. Create EC2 Instance → *48-1.1*  
2. Create S3 Bucket → *48-1.2*  
3. Generate IAM User and Access Key → *48-2.1*
