# **Lecture Notes**

## VPC Peering & Transit Gateway

### VPC Peering

- Enables direct, private connectivity between two VPCs without traversing the Internet.  
- Does not support transitive routing or overlapping CIDRs.

**VPC Peering Limitations:**

- No transitive peering
- No overlapping CIDR blocks
- Limited to 125 peering connections per VPC
- Cross-region peering supported

### AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)

- Acts as a hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-prem networks, simplifying complex mesh topologies.  
- TGW Attachments associate subnets in specific AZs with a TGW.  
- All subnets within the same AZ can reach the TGW once attached.

**Transit Gateway Benefits:**

- Centralized connectivity hub
- Simplified network architecture
- Scalable to thousands of VPCs
- Supports inter-region peering

## VPN & Direct Connect

### Site-to-Site VPN

- Establishes a secure IPSec connection between an on-premises data center and AWS VPC.  
- Consists of:  
  - **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):** AWS-managed, multi-AZ endpoints.  
  - **Customer Gateway (CGW):** Customer-managed device or software appliance.

### AWS Direct Connect

- Provides a dedicated private network connection between an on-prem data center and AWS.  
- Typical latency: 20–30 ms.  
- In Vietnam, available through Hosted Connections (via partners).  
- Bandwidth is adjustable.
